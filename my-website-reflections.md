**Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical file**

What we are doing when we create a repository on Github is something similar to a directory in that it may store other files and objects. It is on GitHub so you, or multiple workers, can choose to work on it remotely. To do this in GitHub, you will select the dropdown menu that looks like a plus sign, located next to your avatar. Select "New Repository" and name it, then save it. It will show up under the Repositories tab on your profile, select the repository, and then copy the "HTTPS" URL. In your terminal, you will clone your repository, by typing: git clone "HTTPS URL" Then it will appear in your local files!

**Describe what open source means**

Open source means that a website chooses to share it's code with the public, which also means anyone can work on the code to the website, or save it for their own. Often, this wide access means improvements can be made from anyone, anywhere.

**What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?**

I think Open Source is an amazing concept, and has limitless potential to create better, constantly improving software and technology that may otherwise be quite limited. I think it's a wonderful thing, with careful regulation.

**What concepts solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?**

The workflow seems to be solidifying after several attempts to start over when I was having difficulty understanding. I think that came after trial and error a few times, and while not an "aha" moment, I am really enjoying learning to use the command line and sublime to create, track and alter files. I feel I'm learning my computer much more intimately. My biggest struggle is getting to learn all the steps of tracking, push then pull, etc. I found it helpful to watch some of the videos after I tried the code out for myself and it starts to make more and more sense.

**Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it**

Yes! I found this short tutorial helpful: http://classic.scottr.org/presentations/git-in-5-minutes/

Also, this (mostly to see git explained in perhaps slightly different terminology, or use of examples, i find those helpful): http://media.pragprog.com/titles/tsgit/chap-005-extract.html
