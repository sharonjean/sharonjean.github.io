  1. What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margins by doing this challenge?
    -I learned that the padding is the spacing between the border and the content
    -the margin controls all the spacing in between elements/boxes
    -and the borders are what contains the content of an element.
    -I learned that you can apply CSS with these elements to manipulate the look you are trying to achieve on your website.

  2. What did you learn about CSS positioning?
    -By using the positioning schemes (relative, absolute, fixed, floating or static), you can control where an object can be placed in relation to other elements, the page, or even the browser.

  3. What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
    -Easiest were the borders, colors, and font types. I felt those were fun to choose (which happened last week), and satisfying to implement.
    -Most difficult was figuring out the positioning, and getting each element exactly where you want them place.

  4. What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
    -It was great practice using the new HTML5 semantic elements, and incorporating those new tags into the stylesheets.
    -I felt like it was a great exercise playing with DevTools, and configuring the site that way first.
