  <h1>what about class?</h1>
  <p>
    We know that Ruby is an object-oriented programming language, so how does class come into the picture? It's good to mention that a class is an object. Using classes, you can create objects in Ruby which are equipped with powerful built-in methods. Yet the real power lies in being able to create new methods that can be used throughout each instance of class.
  </p>

  <p><b>A class about none other than...coffee:</b></p>

  <p id="ruby">
    <pre>
    class Coffee<br />

      def initialize(temp, flavor)<br />
        @temp = temp<br />
        @flavor = flavor<br />
      end<br />

      def temperature<br />
        @temp<br />
      end<br />

      def flavor<br />
        @flavor<br />
      end<br />

      def choice_of_beverage<br />
        puts "Here's your delicious #{@temp} #{@flavor}!"<br />
      end<br />

    end<br />
    </pre>
  </p>

  <p><b>initialize</b></p>

  <p>
    Let's break down what's going on in this class so far. <span class="ruby">initialize</span> is a special method you can use that will set an object's state when (and for each time) it is created. The great part is that Ruby has access to the values (the two arguments shown), as it has been saved by way of <span class="ruby">instance variables.</span></p>

  <p><b>instance variables</b></p>

  <p>
    An <span class="ruby">instance variable,</span> denoted in the example with an <span class="ruby">@ symbol,</span> is an object's variable. So it acts like a local variable, but is available for use between all methods in the class.

  <p><b>instantiation</b></p>

  <p>
    To get the class going, it needs to be instantiated—which is to say that objects created are instances of the class. We can do this by calling the <span class="ruby">.new</span> method on the class like so:</p>
  <p id="ruby">
    best_coffee = Coffee.new("iced", "almond latte")
  </p>

  <p><b>output</b></p>

  <p id="ruby">
    puts best_coffee.choice_of_beverage<br>

    => "Here's your delicious iced almond latte!"
  </p>

  <p>
    The options we can apply to this class are limitless! We can apply the size of the cup, quantity of beverages, and even apply special directions—half decaf, extra hot, hold the whip, anyone?
