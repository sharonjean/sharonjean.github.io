  <h1>enumerable method - map</h1>
  <p>
    The Enumerable module is one of the most widely used set of methods which manipulate collection objects. The search, sort, and map methods are all part of the Enumerable module. Let's take a deeper look at its powers by way of mapping. <br />

    Also called upon as "collect," the map method is one of the most powerful collection operations available. Map always returns an array, and differs from each in this exact way. Whereas the commonly used each method returns its receiver (in that it doesn't save the information its returning), map will return (in an array) the accumulation of the results from iterating through the code block every time it is ran.
