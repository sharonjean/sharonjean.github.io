      Version control—what is it, and why does it matter? Version control is a system allowing its users to save multiple versions of a file, that can be accessed and worked on by any number of people, simultaneously. I know, right?

      For anyone working on teams–particularly those that consistently work with and manipulate a lot of files and save every version–it is an incredibly smart tool to use for efficiency and safety.

        Git and GitHub are two popular systems of version control, and while often confused for one another, they are separate. Using Git, you can save multiple files, and make "commits" to each one, and save them locally. A commit is a saving point for each file, where you can leave a small comment about what is happening at that time, and why changes were made. You can rewind to any of these commits for any reason, at any time. Git will keep a virtual log of each commit, as well, so you can always go back and view that data. Git has the capability of "pushing" these changes and directories (like folders) to GitHub. GitHub is a social site, a lá version control. Many programmers utilize GitHub to store their repositories, and is a place they can view anyone else's public repositories and files. You can even "fork" (or, copy) someone's repository into your own! I'm sure you can see how advantageous that can be to a team who needs to work on the same document, but make different changes. On GitHub, you can then "merge" these documents together, and it will save everyone's changes. Mind blown yet?

        Git and GitHub make files easily accessible, and safe by ensuring all work is catalogued through commits, without having to risk altering the master file. Pull requests are put in place for that very reason, and ensure that you have at least one or more people proof a file before they are able to approve, and then merge any files together. There is other version control software out there to try, and whichever you choose, it's simply a smart solution to workflow.
