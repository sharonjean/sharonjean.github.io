  <h1>regular expressions</h1>
  <p>
    The first time I saw regular expressions (often referred to as Regexp), the code might as well have been written in heiroglyphics. While at first I raised my eyebrow trying to decipher what was going on, I immediately became curious—<i>what is this doing? What does it represent?</i></p>
  <p>
    Well, I'm here to break the mystery down, and I'm happy to report it's not as scary as it might look!</p>

  <p><b>What <i>is</i> a regular expression?</b></p>

  <p>A regular expression is an object in Ruby (identified as Regexp), used to match or identify a pattern against strings. This is accomplished by writing the pattern in literal notation— <span class="ruby">/pattern/ or %r{pattern}.</span> Although some find it difficult to read, and possibly hard to maintain, it's truly a powerful tool that allows you to perform powerful searches and pattern-matching capability.

  <p id="ruby">
    <pre>
    <b>example:</b>

    sunday = "Cloudy with a light chance of rain."
    monday = "Thunderstorms, with high winds."

    if ( sunday =~ /rain(.*)/ )
      puts "sunday contains rain"
    end
    if ( monday =~ /rain(.*)/ )
      puts "monday contains rain"
    end

    => "sunday contains rain"
    </pre>
  </p>

  <p><b>wildcard .(dot) notation</b></p>

  <p>
    What the wildcard dot notation (.) does (also shown in example from above), is search match a specified character, with exception of a newline.</p>
    <p id="ruby">/.s/</p>
    <p>What this will do is search for all 's' characters. That simple! Really, the main function of a regular expression is to search and match for patterns. You can then choose to do other nifty stuff with it, and below are some helpful patterns you may come across, and their descriptors.</p>

  <p><b>Regexp patterns & syntax:</b></p>
  <p id="ruby">
    <pre>
      ^       matches beginning of line
      $       matches end of line
      .       matches a single character (not newline)
      \1...\9 matches nth grouped sub-expression

      (re)    groups regexps & remembers text that matches
      re*     matches 0 or more occurrences of preceding expression
      re+     matches 1 or more occurrences of preceding expression
      re?     matches 0 or 1 occurrence of preceding expression
      re{ n}  matches exactly n number of occurrences of preceding expression

      \A      matches beginning of string
      \b      matches backspace when in bracket notation (word boundaries when outside)
      \B      matches non-word boundaries
      \d      matches digits
      \D      matches non-digits
      \w      matches word characters
      \W      matches non-word characters
      \z      matches end of string

      [...]   matches any single character in brackets
      [^...]  matches any single character not in brackets

    </pre>
