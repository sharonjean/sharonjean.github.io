  <h1>regular expressions</h1>
  <p>
    The first time I saw regular expressions (often referred to as Regexp), the code might as well have been written in heiroglyphics. While at first I raised my eyebrow trying to decipher what was going on, I immediately became curious—<i>what is this doing? What does it represent?</i></p>
  <p>
    Well, I'm here to break the mystery down, and I'm happy to report it's not as scary as it might look!</p>

  <p><b>What <i>is</i> a regular expression?</b></p>

  <p>A regular expression is an object in Ruby (identified as Regexp), used to match or identify a pattern against strings. This is accomplished by writing the pattern in literal notation— <span class="ruby">/pattern/ or %r{pattern}.</span> Although some find it difficult to read, and possibly hard to maintain, it's truly a powerful tool that allows you to perform powerful searches and pattern-matching capability.

    <b>example:</b>

    sunday = "Cloudy with a light chance of rain."
    monday = "Thunderstorms, with high winds."

    if ( sunday =~ /rain(.*)/ )
      puts "sunday contains rain"
    end
    if ( monday =~ /rain(.*/ )
      puts "monday contains rain"
    end

    => "sunday contains rain"
    </pre>
